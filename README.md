**Title: Stock Market Prediction with LSTM and Time Series Analysis**

**Description:**
This repository contains a comprehensive Python codebase for stock market prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and Time Series Analysis techniques. The code leverages financial data from the Yahoo Finance API and employs popular libraries like TensorFlow, NumPy, and Pandas to preprocess data, build the model, and visualize the results. The notebook covers data preprocessing, feature scaling, model building, training, and prediction visualization, offering an end-to-end demonstration of predicting stock prices using deep learning techniques.

**Key Features:**
- Data collection and preprocessing using Yahoo Finance API.
- Implementation of LSTM architecture for time series prediction.
- Feature scaling for input data normalization.
- Visualization of stock price trends and predictions.
- Comprehensive comments and explanations for each step.
- Utilization of Plotly for interactive data visualization.
- Model checkpointing and learning rate reduction for efficient training.
- Saving and loading of model objects for future use.

Explore this repository to gain insights into stock market prediction techniques and how LSTM neural networks can be applied to forecast financial trends. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or a data science enthusiast aiming to enhance your skills, this repository serves as a valuable resource to dive into time series analysis and prediction using deep learning.
